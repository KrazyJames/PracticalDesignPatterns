# Practical Design Patterns

Welcome to this repository, where various design patterns used in iOS application development are compiled and explained.
For futher explanation about the design patterns discussed, please refer to this

## 📌 Introduction
This repository aims to provide clear and concise examples of common design patterns in iOS, facilitating their understanding and implementation in real projects.

## 📂 Implemented Design Patterns
Below are the design patterns implemented in this repository, grouped by category:

### Creational Patterns
- **[Factory](Factory.playground/Pages):** Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **[Prototype](Prototype.playground/Pages):** Creates objects by copying an existing object rather than instantiating a new one.
- **[Singleton](Singleton.playground/Contents.swift):** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Structural Patterns
- **[Adapter](Adapter.playground/Pages):** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge.
- **[Composite](Composite.playground/Pages):** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **[Decorator](Decorator.playground/Contents.swift):** Dynamically adds behavior to an object without modifying its class.
- **[Facade](Facade.playground/Contents.swift):** Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code.
- **[Flyweight](Flyweight.playground/Contents.swift):** Reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **[Iterator](Iterator.playground/Contents.swift):** Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **[Observer](Observer.playground/Pages):** Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified automatically.
- **[State](State.playground/Pages):** Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

## 🚀 How to Use
Each pattern includes a Swift implementation along with a brief explanation of its purpose and how to use it.
